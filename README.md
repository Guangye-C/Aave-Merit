## Introduction <a class="anchor" id="intro"></a>
Aave is the largest onchain decentralized lending and borrowing platform of cryptocurrencies. On January 30, 2024, the Aave community announced a rewards program called Merit, which aims to expand its user base and market dominance on the Ethereum blockchain. The program rewards users who borrow wrapped ETH (WETH) and GHO (Aave's own stablecoin). This project focuses on Merit's impact on WETH, and aims to answer the question: did Merit increase amount of WETH borrowed on Aave on the Ethereum blockchain? I apply [synthetic difference-in-differences](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25532/w25532.pdf), a causal inference method, to estimate the causal relationship between Merit and WETH borrowed from January 30, 2024 to April 30, 2024.
